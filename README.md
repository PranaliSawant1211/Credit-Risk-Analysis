CREDIT GUARD: Financial Risk Analysis

Overview

CREDIT GUARD is a financial risk analysis project focused on predicting financial distress and helping financial institutions mitigate loan default risks. Using Python and Tableau, this project builds a robust credit risk model that delivers actionable insights and visualizes key financial metrics to identify high-risk borrowers.

Project Goals

Predict the likelihood of loan defaults accurately to support decision-making in financial institutions.
Build a credit risk model using Random Forest for its effectiveness in handling complex datasets and reducing overfitting.
Enhance predictive power through advanced feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
Design an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize KPIs and provide strategic insights.

Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries/Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, GridSearchCV

Data Visualization: Tableau


Features


Implemented a Random Forest model for predicting loan defaults.
Conducted advanced feature engineering to improve model performance.
Used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning to optimize model accuracy.

Tableau Dashboard
Designed an interactive dashboard with key performance indicators (KPIs):

Default Rate: Percentage of loans defaulting over time.

Debt-to-Income Ratio: Relationship between income and total debt.

Past Due Payments vs. Delinquency Status: Visual analysis of borrowers with past payment issues.
